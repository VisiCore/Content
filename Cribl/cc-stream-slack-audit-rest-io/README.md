# VisiCore Slack Audit Logs REST Collector
----

This pack pulls all audit activity from the Slack Audit Logs API into your data observability pipeline with audit events like user and AI activity.

It establishes a secure, scheduled polling mechanism to programmatically ingest Slack's audit logs (like workspace creation, user logins, and file downloads) ensuring comprehensive visibility into enterprise security and compliance events.

## About this Pack

*   **Targeted Ingestion**: Pre-configured to poll the `/logs` endpoint every 5 minutes.
*   **Granular Visibility**: Captures all **actions** as defined in the [Slack Audit Reference](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/audit-logs-api/methods-actions-reference), including `user_login`, `file_download`, `preference_change`, and AI events, but can be customized to pull specific actions only.
*   Assisted **OAuth2 Token Generation**: Unlike service-level OAuth, Slack requires interactive user consent to install apps, and log collection must be tied to a Slack Owner user account. The Cribl UI provides no way to provide a return URI for interactive consent or to perform this token exchange. This pack and the associated authentication service close these gaps to allow you to collect Slack logs.

To learn more about the Slack Audit Logs API, visit the [official documentation](https://docs.slack.dev/admins/audit-logs-api/) and the [technical API reference](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/audit-logs-api/methods-actions-reference/) .

## Required prerequisites

*   You must be on a Slack Enterprise plan
*   The Slack Owner must create a Slack App with the `auditlogs:read` scope for authorization
*   An OAuth2 User Token (starting with `xoxp-`, keep reading for step-by-step instructions to generate this token)

## Generate the OAuth2 User Token

You may obtain your token at VisiCore's [Cribl Slack Authorization](https://portal.visicoretech.com/cribl/slack) page.

## Deployment

1. **Install** the pack via Cribl > Stream > Worker Group > Processing > Packs > Add Pack (from the Dispensary).
  - Cribl may try to append the version number to the pack ID. This is designed to be an *upgrade-in-place* pack, so if your pack ID reads anything other than `cc-stream-slack-audit-rest-io`, then change it to that value.
2. From the Packs page, click **Slack Audit Rest Collector**
3. Navigate to **Knowledge** > **Variables** within the Pack.
4. Update `slack_oauth_token` with your Slack **User OAuth Token** (starting with `xoxp-`) retrieved above.
5. (Optional) All other customizable values are also here.
6. **Always** remember to **Commit and Deploy** after changing variables.
7. Celebrate! You now have Slack Audit Logs flowing into your Cribl instance.

## SIEM

If your System of Analysis supports the `index` metadata field, update the pack variable `slack_audit_log_index` to reflect your target index.

This pack is optionally plug-and-play with the [Slack Add-on for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4986) and [Slack Audit App for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5013) . Note that the app expects an index value of `slack_audit` if you want to avoid customizing the Splunk side. Create the index in Splunk before updating this variable.

## Upgrades

As a better practice, please do not modify sources, routes, or pipelines within the pack. Do not insert this Pack (as a Pipeline) into the global Routes table outside of the Pack. All control is designed to be handled through pack variables. If you need functionality not present in the sources, routes, or pipelines, please reach out to <CriblPacks@visicoretech.com> to log a feature request. Modifying these core items can make upgrades... difficult.

To upgrade, use the `Upgrade` option through the `Actions` column on the packs page. If you upload/overwrite, it will destroy any variable settings you have configured (like your `slack_oauth_token`).

Upgrading certain Cribl Packs using the same Pack ID can have unintended consequences. See [Upgrading an Existing Pack](https://docs.cribl.io/stream/packs#upgrading) for details.
